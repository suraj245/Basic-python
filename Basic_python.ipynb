What is Python, and why is it popular\n","\n","ans:- python is a high level programming language, it supports the various applications like web development, data analytics, data science, machine learning. easy to use less coding and most demanding language.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","ans:- Interpreter in python is a program that executes the code line by line.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","ans:- keywords in python are in built key words which have pre-defined meaning which can not be used as identifiers, variables, functions.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","ans:- No, it can't be used.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","ans:- The process of changing the value of elements in list by accessing the index value is called mutability.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","ans:- Lists are mutable because they support the assigning or updating the value to elements, but tuples wont support updating the elements values so tuples are immutable.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","ans:- \"==\" is comparision operator which used to compare the values while performing operations. \"is\" it's identity operator which checks the location of the values.  \n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","ans:- 1. AND 2. OR 3. NOT\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","ans:- The process of changing the data types in list of elements like, sting, int, float, bool.\n","\n","10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","ans:- implicit is automatically done by interpreter like adding integer and float gives float value. but explicit is manually convering data type like string \"100\" converting into integer.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","ans:- Conditional statmets are used to performe the operations based on specific condtions by using operators which executes specific block of code to get exact output.\n","\n","12.  How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","ans:- elif(else if). it works based on if condition is true or false. if condition is false they elif code block will be executed.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","ans:- for loop is used in lists, tuples, range and The loop executes once for each item in the sequence.\n","while loop is used when you working with contions, The loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","\n","ans:- a = \"Hello world!..\"\n","\n","revrse_string = \"\"\n","\n","index = len(a)-1\n","\n","while index >= 0:\n","    revrse_string += a[index]\n","    index -= 1\n","\n","print(revrse_string)"],"metadata":{"id":"HFeyq3G02X2e"}}]}
